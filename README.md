# Heart Disease Prediction & Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using patient clinical data and identifying key medical risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular conditions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze healthcare data to understand heart disease risk patterns
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on clinical attributes
- Build a predictive machine learning model
- Support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare decisions

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation

## 📊 Key Insights
- Age, chest pain type, cholesterol, and exercise-induced angina strongly influence heart disease risk
- Patients with abnormal ECG and high resting blood pressure show higher risk
- Predictive model achieved **~XX% accuracy**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Results
The model helps identify high-risk patients, enabling early medical intervention and improved healthcare outcomes.
